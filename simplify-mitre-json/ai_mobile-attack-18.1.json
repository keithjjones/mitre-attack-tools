For example, a malicious application may register itself as a VPN client, effectively redirecting device traffic to adversary-owned resources. Registering as a VPN client requires user consent on both Android and iOS; additionally, a special entitlement granted by Apple is needed for iOS devices. Alternatively, a malicious application with escalation privileges may utilize those privileges to gain access to network traffic.   \n\n\n Specific to Android devices, adversary-in-the-disk is a type of AiTM attack where adversaries monitor and manipulate data that is exchanged between applications and external storage. To accomplish this, a malicious application firsts requests for access to multimedia files on the device (`READ_EXTERNAL STORAGE` and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`), then the application reads data on the device and/or writes malware to the device. Though the request for access is common, when used maliciously, adversaries may access files and other sensitive data due to abusing the permission. Multiple applications were shown to be vulnerable against this attack; however, scrutiny of permissions and input validations may mitigate this attack.    \n\nOutside of a mobile device, adversaries may be able to capture traffic by employing a rogue base station or Wi-Fi access point. These devices will allow adversaries to capture network traffic after it has left the device, while it is flowing to its destination. On a local network, enterprise techniques could be used, such as [ARP Cache Poisoning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/002) or [DHCP Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/003).  \n\n \n\nIf applications properly encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible to adversaries, depending on the point of capture.

Due to their smaller form factor than traditional desktop endpoints, users may not be able to notice minor differences between genuine and phishing websites. Further, mobile devices have additional sensors and radios that allow adversaries to execute phishing attempts over several different vectors, such as: \n\n- SMS messages: Adversaries may send SMS messages (known as \u201csmishing\u201d) from compromised devices to potential targets to convince the target to, for example, install malware, navigate to a specific website, or enable certain insecure configurations on their device.\n- Quick Response (QR) Codes: Adversaries may use QR codes (known as \u201cquishing\u201d) to redirect users to a phishing website. For example, an adversary could replace a legitimate public QR Code with one that leads to a different destination, such as a phishing website. A malicious QR code could also be delivered via other means, such as SMS or email. In the latter case, an adversary could utilize a malicious QR code in an email to pivot from the user\u2019s desktop computer to their mobile device.\n- Phone Calls: Adversaries may call victims (known as \u201cvishing\u201d) to persuade them to perform an action, such as providing login credentials or navigating to a malicious website. This could also be used as a technique to perform the initial access on a mobile device, but then pivot to a computer/other network by having the victim perform an action on a desktop computer.","tactics":["initial-access"],"platforms":["Android","iOS"],"revoked":false,"deprecated":false,"revoked_by":null,"software":["S1241 (RatMilad)","S1083 (Chameleon)","S1225 (CherryBlos)","G1015 (Scattered Spider)","G1002 (BITTER)","S0289 (Pegasus for iOS)","S1185 (LightSpy)","S1067 (FluBot)","G1029 (UNC788)","G0034 (Sandworm Team)","G1028 (APT-C-23)","S1094 (BRATA)","S1231 (GodFather)","S1208 (FjordPhantom)"],"mitigations":["M1011 (User Guidance)","M1058 (Antivirus/Antimalware)"],"sub_techniques":[]},"T1661":{"name":"Application Versioning","description":"An adversary may push an update to a previously benign application to add malicious code.
